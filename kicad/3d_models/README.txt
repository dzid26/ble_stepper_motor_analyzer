NOTES

STEP and other file formats can be converted using FreeCad to WRL.

If STEP file colors are not shown in FreeCad, see this post about disabling a checkbox in settings.

Under the Import section of Preferences --> Import-Export disabling (unchecking) Enable STEP Compound merge allows colors of the STEP file to show upon import.
